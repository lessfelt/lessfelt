# Hi! I'm Reese.
I'm an undergrad CS student (she/her) based in Canada, where I'm learning **Python** and **C++**. Apart from that, I like learning things the best way I can - by bruteforcing until it works.

In my spare time, I fangirl over (G)I-DLE's Soyeon and play rhythm games. Valorant counts as a rhythm game, right?
