# Hi! I'm Reese.
<img src="https://github.com/kiryu-coco/kiryu-coco/blob/master/coconew.png" alt="Pixel art of Hololive's Coco Kiryu." align="right"> I'm an undergrad CS student (she/her) based in Canada, where I'm learning <b>Python and C++.</b> Apart from that, I like learning things the best way I can - by bruteforcing until it works.

Currently working on <a href="https://github.com/kiryu-coco/miyeonie">Miyeon</a>, a TypeScript Discord bot.

In my spare time, I watch Hololive VTubers and play comfy puzzle/detective games.
